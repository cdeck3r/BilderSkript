This workflow runs the pipelines to compile a BilderSkript.

BilderSkript automatically summarizes a lecture as a sequence of interesting images scenes. Technically, it trains a deep neural net on objection recognition and extracts interesting scenes from a large sequence of still image recordings. Theses scenes compile to the BilderSkript.

The BilderSkript `github repo <https://github.com/cdeck3r/BilderSkript>`_ contains project's details.
