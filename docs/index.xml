      <description>BilderSkript takes a series of still images as input and compiles visual lecture notes as output. Below we illustrate a step-by-step walkthrough how the software processes the data.
Image recording: A 360 camera records the entire room. However, the lens towards the audience is covered to maintain privacy. The images have the typical distorted appearance due to the camera&#39;s fisheye lenses. Nevertheless, it creates an approx. 200 degrees, wide-angle recording.</description>

      <title>IPC via Shared UNIX Sockets</title>

      <description>This is a technical design description on the usage of shared UNIX socket for docker container IPC.
The approach utilizes
 socat for creating sockets and socket communication ss to check for the presence of the listening socket.  It follows a classical client / server approach where the server initializes the socket and waits for the client to start the communication. The following sequence diagrams depicts the interaction over the socket.</description>

      <description>The distribution of pipelines across various docker containers requires interprocess communication between the docker containers. Let&#39;s discuss the design for the BilderSkript pipelines.
IPC Control Problem We have the builder container which controls the execution of all pipelines. A pipeline implements a sequence of processs executions, where some of the processes run in their respective containers. As an example consider the data preparation pipeline. The pipeline in the builder container initiates the image data preparation in the hugin container.</description>

      <description>BilderSkript BilderSkript is a compound created from the following words.
 Bilder [ˈbɪldɐ], (German), images
  Skript [skʁɪpt], (German), a written document or notes
 BilderSkript automatically summarizes a lecture as a sequence of interesting images scenes.
Technically, it trains a deep neural net on objection recognition and extracts interesting scenes from a large sequence of still image recordings. Theses scenes compile to the BilderSkript</description>

      <description>Docker images contain the various software pipelines from the tool chain. The various responsibilities within the overall system design motivate the system boundaries induced by the distribution of pipelines across docker images. The following table list the docker images and their respective pipeline functionalities.

      <title>Documentation Generation</title>

      <description>Docu Blog The project&#39;s documentation is a form of a single-page blog using the Hugo static webpage generator. It lists notes taken during the development and justifies design decisions. The builder docker image takes care of the generation utilizing the script, scripts/make_doc.sh.
The blog utilizes the OneDly theme. This theme is excluded from git versioning because it originates from a separate repository. Usually, one would include it as a git submodule.</description>

      <description>Motivation and Goal A lecturer usually provides a lot of supplemental course material such as a written script, slides, reading material, exercises.
However, students visiting the course&#39;s lecture experience an additional channel, which helps them to sort and weight the supplemental material. The way how a lecturer presents the content will let attendees realize the weight and importance of certain parts of the content. Hence, it supports the creation of a red thread throughout entire supplemental material.</description>

      <title>Versioning and Repository Management</title>

      <description>Pipeline Code and Data Versioning The builder image takes care of versioning using git and dvc.
Pipelines are commonly shared in various volumes.
Repository Management The project&#39;s repository is mounted as separate volume in the builder container. As a consequence, only makefiles in the project&#39;s root dir are able to commit changes to the repository. Scripts in subdirectories are not aware that the project&#39;s root is under git version control. The volumes are organized under the following two mount points.</description>
